# Dev Container for the Docs

This allows us to preview the docs locally without having to install Ruby or Jekyll on our machines.

These docs are hosted on GitHub Pages and use the Just-the-Docs theme.

For more information on dev containers, see [the main README's section on dev containers](../../README.md#dev-containers-for-the-eshoponweb-repo) for details.

## Docs Hosting Environment

The docs are hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub provides a [GitHub Pages Ruby Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) to make it easy for us to run this locally. 

If you want to know more about the dependencies of the GitHub Pages Ruby Gem, they keep track of [Dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/).
